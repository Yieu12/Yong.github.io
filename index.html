			I find Live2D modeling to be very interesting. Unlike a 3D object, a live 2D object moves in such a way that it mimics a 3D object. 
			For example, a new trend that has appeared recently is the boom of <strong>"Vtubers"</strong> using an 2D avatar instead of their cameras or a 3D model. The 2D objects are rigged to follow the 
			users' movement, and if done right, can give the impression of a 3D object in the way in which the rigger <strong>"patches holes"</strong> in the model to seem as if a 3D model is in play.
			Unlike an animated scene, a Live2D object is only <strong>one image with movement</strong> while an animation is multiple frames one after another in quick succession.
			If anyone is interested in starting on Live2D, they can go <a href="https://www.live2d.com/en/" target="_blank">here<a> to begin learning how to rig their own model for free.
